                    You will never believe what happened with me in the past three weeks.<br>
                    I had a Man. Like I was DATING a man.<br>
                    Yes, DATING.<br>
                    It lasted almost three weeks. Pretty good, I assume. Because I didn't think it was going to last even a week.<br><br>

                    It was a usual Saturday night. I was out at the bar.<br>
                    I had seen him before on Monday. We barely talked. He came up to me to say good bye when he was leaving.<br>
                    So we met again on Saturday. Had a chat. He asked me over to his place.<br>
                    He’s hot, tall, a basketball coach, black, awesome dick...so why not?<br>
                    Got to his place. Had amazing sex. Very gentle and passionate.<br>
                    We had fun. I left the next day.<br>
                    Was fun, cute but enough.<br>
                    And 30 mins later he called me.<br>
                    Strange? Yes!<br>
                    He was wondering if I got back safe. What was that supposed to mean? Is he a killer, and now I'm trapped?<br>
                    So we started to talk.<br>
                    He asked me to come over again two days later.<br>
                    I agreed because he has that one gorgeous dick that drove me crazy.<br>
                    And he started to talk about “us”.<br>
                    Strange? Yes!<br>
                    Basically at that moment, he had everything I needed from a man.<br>
                    So when he asked me to be his Woman and fuck nobody else, I agreed.<br>
                    Fuck nobody else.<br>
                    Strange? Yes!<br>
                    The very first week or two were amazing. Like it is always, I assume.<br>
                    I was his Queen, and he wanted only me, and he called me a bunch of times every day, and blah blah blah.<br>
                    The third week.<br>
                    Remember he asked me not to fuck around?<br>
                    Well, during the third week, the basketball team showed up in my city. They were on tour. I was wet. People used to think that cheating is something bad. Well, I don't think the fact of cheating is an actual fact until you fall in love with the person. Which is impossible for me because I have a stone instead of a heart. So yes. I cheated on that amazing dick with another amazing dick. Strange? I don't think so.<br>
                    The other man is kind of a basketball celebrity. So he was cocky and super self-confident. Just the way I like it. He came to me straight away. He knew how much he wanted me. I knew too, I was all wet.<br>
                    I said straight to him that I had a man. He did not care. I liked that.<br>
                    I like men who know what they want and get it.<br>
                    So I let him have me.<br>
                    I wasn't easy to get. I mean I'm not stupid. He knew my man, and I didn’t want to get caught.<br>
                    I played with that kitten for a few days before he could get me. That teasing is the best.<br>
                    So while “my man” did not give a fuck about me because he was behaving like a pussy - I was all wet just because of talking with this basketball celebrity. And don't get me wrong. I figured out he was celebrity only after. And probably that was the first time in his life when he didn't get what he wanted from the beginning. I am cocky.<br>
                    This guy was completely different. He was hard and rough. We were fighting, slapping each other and pulling hair, fucking rough. My ass literally had red marks from his hand (If you know what I mean).<br>
                    He wanted me so hard. He was shouting all over the streets that I'm his girlfriend. Which was crazy. And cute.<br>
                    And his tongue. Oh My! His tongue was something special that was sent to me from Heaven. And I'm not joking. THREE times in a row.<br>
                    IN<br><br>

                    A<br>
                    ROW.<br>
                    THREE!!!<br>
                    TIMES!!!<br>
                    And it was like 7 times he went down on me.<br>
                    Here comes math.<br>
                    And I was talking only about tongue.<br>
                    Did I regret that I cheated? No!<br>
                    So anyway..I had three amazing days. We had fun. He left. Keep texting me though.<br>
                    And now let me remind you that all this time, “my man” was cold as a bitch to me.<br>
                    And as you can remember, I do like people, but I love me more. So after a phone phrase from him “Why you were staring at me at the bar when I was with my friend if you have my pictures on your phone?!”<br>
                    I said “Man, we are D-O-N-E.”<br>
                    I mean come on, dude!!!!<br>
                    You will never ever get someone like me again.<br>
                    And me?<br>
                    I can have 5 better guys tomorrow.<br>
                    And this is how it ended.<br>
                    Well, not really. He still has my stuff, and he saw me last night, but again...was a pussy and texted me, no face-to-face talk. But that’s not the fun part of the story.<br>
                    The truth in this story though, is that I am not a relationship person. I deserve happiness. And that was a good reminder.<br>
                    So with my friend’s words “Welcome back to normal life,” I am officially back and have a bunch of guys to make stories with.<br>
                    By the way, let me know if you want to hear more about that cocky basketball celebrity.<br>
                    I’ll keep you posted.<br>
