                    After I left N’s apartment and took the elevator ten floors down, I was laughing about how damn good I was up there and how heartless at the same time.<br>
                    Suddenly, I got a message from M. He wished me goodnight and said he was looking forward to seeing me again. I bet he did.<br><br>

                    Next morning, I woke up with a little hangover. But it was a day off and brilliant weather outside. So me and my girl decided to go shopping. Our shopping didn't last long though.<br>
                    A message from M basically woke me up, and we constantly texted from then on.
                    We agreed to meet closer to his place.<br><br>

                    We met, had lunch, and went to his place.<br>
                    M was three years younger than me compered to N, who was nine years older than me.<br>
                    What do you usually expect from guys who are younger?<br>
                    Nothing much, right?<br>
                    Well, not this time. Actually I think it’s just a stereotype.<br>
                    We think if he's younger, he lost his virginity not that long ago (I’m talking about guys in their early 20’s), and probably most of his partners were his age or even younger, so what he can know about pleasing me?<br>
                    But ladies, I can assure you, that so far 95% of the younger guys that I have slept with were amazing in bed, and they had nice personalities, too. I mean handsome, funny, and quite smart for their age. Those 5% were lame. Confession. But I’ll tell you what. Those lame, are going to be lame and when they are 30 plus, they are still going to be lame, believe me.<br>
                    Younger boys are so full of energy and passion. They are not afraid of anything. Point for that.
                    And they are always trying to impress you. Huge point for that, and I have to admit that this was adorable.<br>
                    At M’s place, we didn’t waste our time and went straight to the point of why we were there. Sex.
                    He started to kiss me. Great kisser. His tongue was soft and he liked to kiss mid-deep. Which is perfect.<br>
                    We have all had those guys who were trying to reach deepen our thoughts. I call it deep-throat kissing. Not hot.<br>
                    This time kissing with M was so good. We sucked each others tongues, and it made my panties so wet and his dick hard.<br>
                    He took my bra off and started to suck my nipples. That was incredible. Love when my boobs get the attention they deserve.<br>
                    And as a real young gentleman, he went down slowly. Down to my pussy. Kissing, licking, sucking. That guy is a great sucker for sure.<br>
                    I almost came. He stopped. I saw an evil look in his eyes. I knew that look. I gave it to guys way too often. A teaser look.<br>
                    I went down on him.<br>
                    Dick.<br>
                    Pink, nice, delicious, and a bit too long for me. But I had to handle it. In my throat and in my pussy. Six times.<br>
                    Six times in a row with small breaks in between.<br>
                    Can you remember the last time you had sex six times in a row?<br>
                    I have no idea how my pussy handled that and how we didn't break his dick. My legs were shaking. I don’t remember how many times I came. It was like I was coming all along, non stop.<br>
                    We tried all the positions we knew.<br>
                    Don’t think he took Viagra though.<br>
                    First of all, I am walking Viagra by myself.<br>
                    Second of all, heard it doesn’t go down until the end of the effect.<br>
                    Well, this one did go down and up. So I assume I'm the only drug who kept him moving.<br>
                    After we both were super tired. I got text from my girl. She asked me to stay wherever I am because she wanted her guy to stay over. So I stayed at M’s place.<br>
                    We got bored. We could not have sex anymore, so we didn't find anything better to do but to talk to N. All three together.<br>
                    And that time I realised...I hurt N. He was falling for me. But of course he didn't admit it.
                    In my head, I thought how awesome it would be if I knew M earlier, so we could have time for a threesome.<br><br>

                    And in N’s head, I was a bitch. I knew because he told me so.<br>
                    He also told me that he couldn't believe that I slept with his friend while he didn't even make it to the airport yet.<br>
                    Did I feel sorry?<br>
                    Can’t say so.<br>
                    I had a question that bothered me more.<br>
                    Why did he blame me and not M?<br>
                    He couldn't answer. Not even now.<br>
                    I didn't need any answers. It was too obvious by that time.<br>
                    Remember, I told you N was like me but with a dick.<br>
                    That is what happened. He couldn't believe that he finally had feelings for someone. He didn't want to admit it even to himself. I wouldn’t admit something like that. I can understand him.<br>
                    This story happened more than a year ago.<br>
                    Less than two month ago, N was in my city. Didn't even send me a note about it.<br>
                    If I were him, I wouldn't as well.<br>
                    Going back to the story about M. Well, the sex was amazing. We agreed to meet up again.<br>
                    Never happened.<br>
                    He left to go back to his country three weeks after we met.<br>
                    I moved to another city in four weeks.<br>
                    But I’ll never forget our magic number six.<br>
                    I’ll keep you posted.<br>
