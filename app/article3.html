                    First there was an asian tiny guy after was Damn Runner...I needed a break. And since I’ve moved to a new area I needed to find new friends. And I did.<br>
                    I met them at the supermarket. Two guys. I was shopping and one of them almost broke his neck staring at me.<br><br>

                    They both were early 30’s. Both were quite handsome, but not my type.<br>
                    I thought so.<br>
                    One of them had a wife in the another country, and the other one was as free as bird. Just like me. We lived in the same building with ten floors in between.<br>
                    They invited me to their party later that evening, but I was smashed and needed rest, so I declined. So by that time, we were at the elevator, and we exchanged numbers with the free bird, just in case.
                    Yeah, right.<br>
                    Let’s call that free bird N.<br>
                    N was tall and handsome with classic rough Slovenian accent, and he was way too charming and charismatic, but not my type. We went out for a drink a few days later. That same week, we went for dinner and then movie.<br>
                    Why did I agree? I have no idea. Probably because as I said, he was too charismatic. He was quite an interesting person to talk to as well, but obviously he wanted to fuck me. Of course movies were at his place.<br>
                    This is the moment that got weird. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to fuck him at all. Like all other girls, I assume, I usually, can say from the first sign wether I would fuck the dude or not. I could not do the trick this time.<br>
                    We came to his place to the bedroom. We were lying on his bed watching movies. And I still didn't know. I had no feelings for the guy. What was wrong with me?<br>
                    He kissed me, and after a few minutes, he was already pulling my tights down to go down on me. It was okay, not anything fantastic, but enough to get a girl wet.<br>
                    Well, I could say that he wasn’t that good at going down because he was not that good of a kisser. You know those guys who kiss without tongue? Well, it works only if he has big lips, like black guys have. They can just suck on your lower lip, and you are already damn wet. But it’s not sexy like when you are afraid to open your mouth because something scary is going to eat you up.<br>
                    Anyway, after those pity ‘fuckers’ I had - I was more interested in his size and quality of moves. And here was where happiness happened.<br>
                    His dick was pink, thick and long. Perfect. That’s all I needed.<br>
                    To hold it in my mouth... it was such a pleasure. No joke. It’s like you had to eat some nasty food and finally you had something proper according to your taste. High quality.<br>
                    He put the condom on and went straight inside of me. The feeling was good. I felt so full inside. And I had missed this feeling a lot. He knew how to move, was rough, but not too much so it was enough to make me cum. He was a gentleman and made me cum a few times before he did it himself.<br>
                    So even though he was not a great kisser, he was a great fucker. Point for that.
                    He made me cum. Oh he made me cum a lot of times afterwards.<br>
                    But after we finished, I just put my clothes on and left. It wasn’t an escape or something like that. I just didn’t care.<br>
                    And that’s what was weird. I simply didn’t care - about seeing him again, fucking him again, About any reason that I could possibly think of.<br>
                    Why was it weird? Well, if sex was good, why didn’t I want to do it again?<br>
                    I am a selfish fucking bitch, I know.<br>
                    The moment after I left I felt nothing - an amazing feeling. You should all try it sometime.<br>
                    And that feeling lasted nearly 4 months. All those 4 months, we were fucking.<br>
                    We agreed on my conditions. We could fuck whoever we wanted, but his bed was only for me.<br>
                    We talked about all his fucks and those girls. I liked that he was super open-minded.<br>
                    It’s very rare with guys. So basically I knew everyone he slept with. With all the details.<br>
                    Of course at the beginning he didn't want to tell me anything. “Not to hurt my feelings”, he used to say. Haha. I wish I had any.<br><br>

                    After 4 months, he was leaving for another country for good. We had a goodbye party. He invited all the people he met during the time he was living in the city. Of course, most of them were girls. Girls he was fucking. And me. And a few guys.<br>
                    It was Wednesday night, so less than 10 people came. But it was nice. We went to a club with an open bar. I was chill and drunk. Danced a lot and was enjoying myself. Two girls was trying to do their dance on his dick. That was hilarious. So when just the two of us were at the bar grabbing more drinks, I gave him two condoms and asked him to go and fuck those two girls in the bathroom.<br><br>

                    Why? Probably because I am a psycho and as a good psycho, I still had no feelings.<br><br>
                    But he refused my offer and said kind of romantic a words, too bad I didn't feel anything.<br>
                    He said:” I don't want to fuck any girl here. I want to fuck you in our bed.”<br>
                    Awwwww, right?<br>
                    But I was more like “Loser! Someone is falling in love with me!” And I was serious.<br>
                    Actually he said that pretty often to me. That I was falling for him.<br>
                    But that time, he said:”No, I’m not falling. But you should know that you have stone instead of heart in here”, and he pointed to my chest.<br>
                    That was a good compliment, by the way.<br>
                    On the last evening before his flight, we went out with friends to have dinner. We met up with old friends and a few new. Those few were from the party I didn't go to 4 months ago. Stupid me. N’s best friend was damn hot. Let’s call him M. We were chatting almost all evening with M, and N started to get jealous. M took my number and kissed my lips as a goodbye. I went home with N. He still needed to pack things so we had okay goodbye sex, and because I was drunk enough to realise that I am a damn good actress, I cried. Yes. Cried.<br>
                    So I made him believe that I did have some feelings for him and left.<br>
                    Told you, I am a damn good actress, but that was a mistake because he believed it, and I was lying.
