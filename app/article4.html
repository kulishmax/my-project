                    One of my close friends asked me to write an article for her video blog about how exactly I met all the guys I fucked. There are no extremely secret rules. Usually it happens by accident. But I found it could be interesting even for me because I swear to you, I have no fucking idea how all these things happened to me. So I agreed to help her.<br><br>

                    Before I started to write, I searched some information online to check what super famous and expert people tell us to do - the simple girls. So I googled, “How to meet a guy?”
                    First. Never thought I would google this.<br><br>

                    Second. To my great disappointment I found out all those people are idiots. Literally. Instead of “how”, they tried to tell me “where”. I mean, come on, lonely girl doesn’t mean stupid. She’s not too shy to go out somewhere but maybe she is too shy enough to make the first move. She might know where, but tell her how. That’s what she asked Google.<br><br>

                    That’s why I’d like to tell you a few “how” methods from my own experience. Real life and real situations. No details hiding. You know me, that’s why you love me. I have a bunch of these stories, trust me. They are all hilarious, silly and funny, so let’s cut it to five for now. Five absolutely real stories and suggestions for “how to pick up a guy?”. I can’t promise that you’ll meet your destiny using this info. Shit happens though, but one-night-stand. Definitely.<br><br>

                    So that’s how it’s gonna be. Every week, next five weeks I’ll post one story or some advice. Five weeks- five stories. I’ll type the word “five” one more time. Just to make sure. Lol.<br><br>
                    Maybe you won’t even read this, but maybe someone will and she might get laid. So think twice before you decide not to read me.<br><br>

                    There was nothing sexy in this post, I know. I’ll keep you posted.<br><br>
