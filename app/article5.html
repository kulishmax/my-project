                    So I as promised five “how pick up a guy” methods and suggestions are waiting for you. Let’s start from the beginning. Number one.<br>
                    Number one. Eye contact + slightly shy smile.<br>
                    I think your thoughts right now are like “Yeah, wow, thanks. Like I never knew that before, bitch”. And you are right. I’m not teaching you anything new, but. Here is a huge “but”. It’s too important not to overdo it. You need to make this eye contact kind of unexpectedly, and after, give that guy an easy and light smile. This part you need be careful with. Your smile should be nice and cute, not you showing all of your 32 teeth. From my experience, I had trouble with this a few times. Because if I really like a guy, I have that stupid smile on my face, which is hard to hide. But so far, I can control it. So after you made eye contact with a guy and smile it’s the right time to pretend to be shy and look away. Next move is for the guy. If he’s interested he will come and introduce himself.<br><br>

                    Usually it works, although there were a few epic situations that happened with me.
                    Once I met a guy like this. He was from somewhere in Paraguay or something. He was handsome and tall, and we were both drunk. After half an hour of talking, we left the bar and went straight to my place. There, we started to kiss, and I just needed a good fuck, so I didn’t waste my time and went straight to sit on his dick. It was not that bad as it could be, but after, he said to me to suck his dick. Not in the mood, not in the mood, so I refused. Then, he made a huge mistake that came from out of his mouth. First he started to whine and when it didn’t work, he started to offer me money for my blowjob, so I kicked him out.<br><br>

                    But that doesn’t happen that often. Usually you just talk, and the guy asks for your number, and you can even build a relationship or whatever normal people build.<br>
                    I hope you will try this method and are successful.<br><br>

                    Method number two is coming next week. I’ll keep you posted.<br>
