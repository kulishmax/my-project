                    Method number two.<br>
                    Asking for help.<br>
                    Let’s make it clear. There are only a few things that real women can’t do by themselves, but why should we do them if we have men? I think here besides “how”, I’ll explain “where” to meet a guy by asking for help. So excuse me.<br>
                    Dancing. You can ask some guy to explain to you the moves you’ve already learned. I always try to act like I have never danced before in my life. It’s funny.<br>
                    Gym/martial arts. Sometimes I’m really afraid of those big trainer machines. And I have no idea how to adjust it for my size after some huge bodybuilder. I ask the cutest guy in the gym to help me. You can ask the guy how to work the machine. This method is not that good if you’re going ask the gym trainers. They will help you with joy because they are getting paid for it. You also have Plan B - Yoga and stretching. After class you can ask the guy you liked to help you. Men are more gentle with women’s bodies, because they too afraid of hurting us. I like to stretch my body in front of guys, even if I don’t like any go the guys. It’s motivating. For them, not for me.<br>
                    Coffee shop. You can ask a guy to hold your cup while you need to find something in your bag. Once I met guy and fucked him after a football match. I was about to go sit with my beer and turned around in a rush and ran on him. Who knew he was just right behind me? So I spilt my beer on him. And like in all those silly romantic movies, I instinctively took a tissue and tried to clean it, and it was in balls area as well. When I realized what exactly I was doing, I stopped, and we started to laugh.<br>
                    That was my first foreign guy I slept with. He was British. It wasn’t that good like I imagined. His dick was like wimpy sausage and he wasn’t as active as I prefer a guy to be, but it was nice experience though. I slept with him twice because I was hoping the second time would be better. It wasn’t. Shit happens, right?<br>
                    I’ll keep you posted.<br>
