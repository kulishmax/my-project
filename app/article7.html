                    Method number three.<br>
                    You need to idolize yourself, no need to go lover on the food chain. You are not the only hot woman around in universe. I’m here as well. So all you need is to put together all your confidence at once. And after you inspire yourself, a man will definitely feel your energy and will make the first step.<br>
                    I was 16 when I tried this method for the first time. And it has never let me down since. Basically I used it because I didn’t have any other tricks for a guy who was about 7 years older than me.<br>
                    Yes. Here I’m gonna tell you about my first time. My first experience. My first sex.<br>
                    I remember that day. It was a cold spring evening. My friend invited me to a house party. I knew almost everyone there including my first. It was a big group of fun people. My first was with a woman he was occasionally fucking. She was older than him and besides all of it she was his boss, I guess. I remembered him from the previous parties. He was a big muscles guy in his mid 20’s. He always payed attention to all of the ladies, and when he laughed no one could handle their reflections. But I was good friend of his best friend. I was a little young lady, sometimes too sassy for my age. I got most of his attention. In an instinct, I realized I wanted him to be my first. Tonight.<br>
                    Let’s not forget that I was 16. I knew how to behave with boys who were a few years older but not with an adult guy. So I let our common friend do all work. I texted him directly: “I want lost my virginity tonight with first.” My friend was a bit shocked. I mean, you know, it’s not the kind of message you usually get. But he did everything perfectly. After 30 mins, first’s lady-boss was going back home. Alone. Evil me.<br>
                    After the party ended, we went to my friend’s place. Of course, on my way to his place, I had those sober thoughts, “What I am doing? Am I sure about it?” But obviously, it was a bit late to ask myself this. I decided it for sure. Yes. Tonight. With him.<br>
                    I liked the way it happened. Everyone knew why we were there. No responsibilities. No relationship. No love.<br>
                    Yes I have always had this same state of mind since forever.<br>
                    In bed he was gentle. We kissed a lot before he went down on me. I guess it was the first time a guy ate me out, and it was really nice and good. Don’t want to compare because that time my experience, except porn was equal to zero. He went down for a short time, I guess because I was already so wet, so there were no point to wait any longer. He put his condom on and went straight there.<br>
                    And when he got to the point, I can’t say I felt horrible, but it was super- duper painful. It was not that awesome as it is now, but the feeling was cool. Like someone’s dick in your vagina, you know.<br>
                    It was not long though. Thanks to the universe that my man could understand that I could not do it any longer, so he didn’t come. Me as well. It was not a big deal that night. And no blood by the way.<br><br>

                    After that, we slept together a few more times. He always was teased by my confidence and couldn’t understand how a 16-years-old-girl could have so much of him. And only my smiling and kissing him was the answer.<br>
                    He was a great lover, a good person, and my friend.<br><br>

                    Unfortunately, a few years later, he passed away.<br>
                    I cried for several hours after I talked on the phone with our friend. I wish he could have lived longer.<br>
                    Rest in peace, my lovely first lover.<br>
