                    Method number four<br>
                    Go first. No, it’s not that scary. I’ve been told that to make the first move is a very desperate move and no girl should do that. Bullshit. Screw those people. I like to introduce myself first. No shit. Probably sometimes, I just don’t want to wait, because guys can be so slow most of the time and because I prefer to pick a guy, not the other way. There are two good things about this method.<br>
                    First of all, you have plenty of time to put your thoughts together.<br>
                    Second, you definitely will surprise your target in a good way.<br>
                    I like to start the conversation using easy topics. Once, in one of cities in Asia, I felt bored and a little bit lonely so I went to one of those small shops to grab some beers, and I saw a group of cute guys who were in the same shop area I was walking by. After a few seconds of putting my thoughts together I came and said something like, “hi, I’m bored and it seems like you are fun, so I’m going to party with you tonight. I won’t lie to you. Unfortunately, it’s not a romantic story and I didn’t meet my soulmate, destiny or whatever, but it was one of the funniest nights in my life for sure. And I had good sex which is always a plus. So there were four guys. Three were from Germany, one was Asian but raised in Australia. Don’t know why, but I picked Asian-Australian guy. After we visited at least twenty bars with the crew we decided finally to get a room. That was a super classic one- night-stand-with-a-stranger hotel. There were only two tv channels, and both were porn, and not even good porn, to be honest. We went straight to the things we were there for. His dick wasn’t that big. Maybe some of you heard those legends about Asian dicks. I guess they are true. Can’t say it went deep inside, well, because, I mean, you know. But the guy was trying hard. You know those words you can’t blame a guy for trying. That was the exact expression for this situation. He was quite rough, which was good. And quick, which is not that good. And when I say quick, I mean literally super quick. But who cares? That time I was already so tired. Guess I was partying for 25 hours already and I really needed to sleep. So I wasn’t upset. And in the morning, we went in different directions, and I never saw him again. Besides this, in few days I went out with one of those German guys and had fun as well. But let’s keep that story until the next time, ladies.<br>
                    By the way, to make all this easier for you, I mean the “go first” part, you can either say the truth about yourself, or you can lie. Do whatever makes you feel more confident.<br>
                    I’ll keep you posted.<br>
